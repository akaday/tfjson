## Security Practices and Guidelines

To ensure the security of our project, we follow these practices and guidelines:

1. **Regular Security Audits:**
   - Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
   - Use automated security tools to scan the codebase for known vulnerabilities.

2. **Dependency Management:**
   - Keep all dependencies up to date to avoid known security issues.
   - Use tools like `npm audit` to identify and fix vulnerabilities in dependencies.

3. **Code Reviews:**
   - Perform thorough code reviews to ensure that security best practices are followed.
   - Encourage peer reviews to catch potential security issues early.

4. **Secure Coding Practices:**
   - Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
   - Use input validation and output encoding to protect against injection attacks.

5. **Access Control:**
   - Implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality.
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.

6. **Incident Response:**
   - Have an incident response plan in place to handle security incidents effectively.
   - Regularly review and update the incident response plan to address new threats and vulnerabilities.

7. **Security Training:**
   - Provide security training to all team members to raise awareness about security best practices.
   - Encourage continuous learning and staying up to date with the latest security trends and threats.
